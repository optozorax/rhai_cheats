# ![Logo](/static/logo.png) Rhai Language Cheat Sheet

**A single-page Rhai language reference for people who like high information density.**

Use cases, in order of priority:
* **identification & lookup guide** for constructs encountered in Rhai scripts,
* **discover** parts of the language you might not know,
* **learn the Rhai language** if you have prior programming experience.


# Building

Built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), the static site generator written in Rust. See [`.zolaversion`](.zolaversion) for the exact version the official site was deployed with. To develop locally download the indicated version, then run:

```
zola serve
```
